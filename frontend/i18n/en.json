Your data will only be displayed to users who received an access token from one of the authorized NGOs.</p><p>For allowing users to choose a suitable supervisor, we ask for language skills and a list of offers you might be willing to provide.<br/>When you provide support in person, we additionally ask for your country and zip code. This allows users to sort results by distance.<br/>Next to the data evaluated during the search, there are text inputs for describing your specialization and motivation. Optionally you can also upload a profile picture.<p>Of course you can change or delete all this data at any point.<br/>The application was developed with the approach of privacy by design.
